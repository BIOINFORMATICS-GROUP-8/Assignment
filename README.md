## GROUP 8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Our deepest gratitude goes to Almythy God who has provided all that was needed to complete this assignment

and the programming for which it was undertaken for. There was never lack or want. 

Throughout this entire study, He took care of everything that would have stopped us in our tracks 

and strengthened us even through my most difficult times.
